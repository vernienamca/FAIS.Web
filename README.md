# Fixed Asset and Information System (FAIS)

## Description
The application aims to automate the recording, maintenance and updating of books and register of TransCo’s fixed assets and to supplement the Fixed Asset Management and Fixed Asset Accounting functions of the corporation. 

In a nutshell, FAIS will record and track all Transco-owned property, plant, and equipment (PPE) throughout its lifecycle from energization, installation, project completion to disposal. The system will be a centralized documentation of TransCo’s asset register data to ensure efficient monitoring of movement of Transmission Assets and Other Utility Assets. It shall facilitate monitoring of various activities such as the pre- to on-going construction of engineering projects, completion of work orders, asset movement, renovation and repair of buildings, acceptance, issuance, and disposal made by the corporation.
